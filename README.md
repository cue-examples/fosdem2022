At [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/), [Marcel van
Lohuizen](https://twitter.com/mpvl_) and [Paul
Jolly](https://twitter.com/_myitcv) presented ["A practical guide to CUE:
patterns for everyday
use"](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/cue_pratical_guide/). A recording
of the talk will soon be made available on https://video.fosdem.org/2022.
Meanwhile, the slides are available
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BycB_WevWQfzSoyGHuAIQOWQhbq4npU2aPVs14tiDa4/edit?usp=sharing).

The main goal of the talk is to present a practical guide to CUE with patterns
and techniques to help drive CUE adoption in your project or company.

The talk features a demonstration in which we imagine what such an adoption path
might look like for Acme.com, a fictional company who have a simple Go,
Kubernetes and grpc-based setup. The demo shows how and where the company
gradually adopt CUE.

This repository contains a guide to recreate the demo locally, step-by-step,
using a Docker container for convenience.

The guide can be found [here](./guide/guide_fosdem2022_en.markdown).
