## `cue-examples/fosdem2022`

At [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/), [Marcel van Lohuizen](https://twitter.com/mpvl_) and [Paul Jolly](https://twitter.com/_myitcv) presented ["A practical guide to CUE: patterns for everyday use"](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/cue_pratical_guide/). A [recording of the talk](https://video.fosdem.org/2022/D.infra/cue_pratical_guide.webm) is made available and also [the slides](url).

The main goal of the talk is to present a practical guide to CUE with patterns
and techniques to help drive CUE adoption in your project or company.

The talk features a demonstration in which we imagine what such an adoption path
might look like for Acme.com, a fictional company who have a simple Go,
Kubernetes and grpc-based setup. The demo shows how and where the company
gradually adopt CUE.

This repository contains a guide to recreate the demo locally, step-by-step,
using a Docker container for convenience.

The guide can be found [here](./guide/guide_fosdem2022_en.markdown).
