// This schema can be used anywhere within the module to verify files using

//
// Here, :kube tells CUE to load the kube package scoped from the current
// directory, creating a "package instance". A package instance includes all
// constraints defined in the package (in this case "kube") from the current
// directory and all its ancestor directories within the same CUE module, which

// This explains how we tell Kubernetes objects apart.
//
// For those already familiar with CUE, note that Service and Deployment
// are not defined as definitions (#Service and #Deployment). This is a result
// of how these definitions evolved. They started as constraints on YAML,
// without any underlying schema. In other words, the schema were not known.
// As soon as schema are mixed in (see kube_defs.cue),  however, Service and
// Deployment will behave identically.
//
// A drawback of using "regular" fields for these definitions is that they will
// be output as part of export and friends. As a matter of style, we
// distinguish the types from data fields by starting them with an uppercase
// letter, but export does not similarly distinguish such fields.
//
// In this application that is not an issue that the types are considered to
// be data. In case it is, though, there are several alternatives:
// 1) move the types to a separate packages, allowing to refer to them as,
//    for instance, types.Service and types.Deployment. This looks neat, but
//    makes it harder to use hierarchical constraints.
// 2) use hidden fields: _Service and _Deployment. Like definitions, hidden
//    fields are excluded from exports.
// 3) we could support a @export(ignore) attribute to exclude fields.
//    We would love to hear from you if you are interested in this feature.
